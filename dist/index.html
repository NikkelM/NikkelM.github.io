				<h2>üìú About me</h2>
				<p>
					Hi, I'm Nikkel, currently studying towards my bachelor's degree in IT-Systems Engineering at the Hasso-Plattner-Institute in Potsdam.<br>
					I'm always open to learn and try out new things, but am especially interested in machine learning, CI/CD and everything that makes workflows more efficient! <br>
				  In autumn of 2022, I joined the Site Reliability team of the Azure cloud platform at Microsoft Dublin, where I was responsible for extending monitoring functionalities for a number of core Azure services.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 2014 my family and I moved from my hometown of Kiel, Germany to Varese in northern Italy, where I lived until my graduation from the European
					School of Varese in Summer 2019. In 2017 I had the opportunity to do an internship in San Francisco, California, where I learnt about the 
					"Silicon Valley Mindset" and a new way of working collaboratively. In 2019 I started studying towards my Bachelor's degree in IT-Systems Engineering at the 
					Hasso-Plattner-Institute in Potsdam, Germany, which I intend to finish in Summer 2023.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have recently submitted my bachelor thesis <i>"Monitoring of Agents for Dynamic Pricing in different Recommerce Markets"</i>
					(which can be found <a href="https://bit.ly/MollenhauerBachelorThesisPortfolioWebsite" target="_blank">here</a>),
					which is based on my bachelor's project run in cooperation with <a href="https://www.getfeather.io/" target="_blank" class="hide">Feather by SAP</a>,
					<i>"Online Marketplace Simulation: A Testbed for Self-Learning Agents"</i> (<a href="https://bit.ly/MollenhauerBachelorsProjectPortfolioWebsite" target="_blank">here</a>),	which I worked on together with a small group of other students.

				<h2>üíª Projects</h2>
				<h3>üåê The Website</h3>
				<p>
					I built this website in early April 2022, after I had gained some first Web-Development experience during my studies.
					To challenge myself and to allow for as much creativity as possible, I decided to use <a href="https://threejs.org/" class="hide">three.js</a> for the project,
					as this would allow me to revisit my knowledge of 3D-Computergraphics, which I had last involved myself with two years prior.
					The website is hosted using <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" class="hide">Github pages</a>,
					and its source code can be found in <a href="https://bit.ly/MollenhauerPortfolioWebsitePortfolioWebsite" target="_blank">this repository</a>.
				</p>
				<h3>üéì Bachelor's project</h3>
				<h4><i>Online Marketplace Simulation: A Testbed for Self-Learning Agents</i></h4>
				<p>
					At the HPI, the bachelor's project is a year long software project run in cooperation with a renowned industry partner.
					My team, comprised of six students, worked in collaboration with <a href="https://www.getfeather.io/" target="_blank" class="hide">Feather by SAP</a>,
					building a simulation platform for online marketplaces, upon which we applied, tested and compared various reinforcement learning algorithms on their proficiency in setting dynamic prices in recommerce market environments.
					Please refer to <a href="https://bit.ly/MollenhauerBachelorsProjectPortfolioWebsite" target="_blank">this repository</a> to learn more about the project.
				</p>
				<h3>üéì Bachelor's thesis</h3>
				<h4><i>Monitoring of Agents for Dynamic Pricing in different Recommerce Markets</i></h4>
				<p>
					It is customary for a student's bachelor's thesis to be based on insights gained from the bachelor's project, and to further investigate a core theme of the project.
					My bachelor's thesis focuses on different approaches to the monitoring of reinforcement learning agents, in the specific context of our market simulation framework.
					You can find the thesis in <a href="https://bit.ly/MollenhauerBachelorThesisPortfolioWebsite" target="_blank">this repository</a>.

				<h2>üìñ Experience - Internships</h2>
				<h3>Microsoft, Dublin - Fall 2022</h3>
				<p>
					From September to November 2022, I joined the Site Reliability team of the Azure cloud platform at Microsoft Dublin. 
					I was responsible for creating entirely new monitoring probes covering core Azure services for the synthetic monitoring
					of the Azure Resource Manager Control Plane, allowing on-call engineers to identify and mitigate incidents that
					potentially affect millions of customers earlier & more reliably.
				</p>
				<h3>NDR (Northern German Broadcasting), Kiel - Summer 2018</h3>
				<p>
					During this internship, which I organized out of curiosity, I was able to get to know the inner workings of one of Germany's biggest public broadcasting companies.
					I was involved in all steps of the production of the daily evening news, from planning reports to filming, editing and live taping. I was also able to get to know
					how different live-TV and radio formats get produced.
				</p>
				<h3>Enterprise Garage Consultancy, San Francisco - Summer 2017</h3>
				<p>
					Over the course of this Student internship I was coached by the companies Founder & CEO, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marioherger/" class="hide">Mario Herger</a>.
					Together, we welcomed delegations from German companies to learn about the "Silicon Valley Mindset", and how they could transform their company's culture to become
					more open-minded and diverse. To achieve this, we visited personalities from the Silicon Valley's Tech-Start-Up scene to talk about what makes working in the SF Bay Area
					different.<br>
					An additional task of mine was to assist in planning, conducting and editing Interviews with Engineers from both Tesla and Liquid Motors about the way the Automobile
					industry is changing to become more environmentally conscious.
