				<h2>üìú About me</h2>

					<b><i>"Monitoring Reliability and Robustness of Agents for Dynamic Pricing in different (Re-)Commerce Markets"</i></b>,<br>
					which is based on my bachelor's project <br>
					<b><i>"Online Marketplace Simulation: A Testbed for Self-Learning Agents"</i></b>,<br>

				<h2>üíª Projects</h2>
				<h3>üåê The Portfolio website</h3>
				<p>
					I started this portfolio website in early April 2022, after I had gained some first Web-Development experience during my studies.
					To challenge myself and to allow for as much creativity as possible, I decided to use <a href="https://threejs.org/" class="hide">three.js</a> for the project,
					as this would allow me to revisit my knowledge of 3D-Computergraphics, which I had last involved myself with two years prior.
					The source code for this website can be found on <a href="https://github.com/NikkelM/portfolio" target="_blank">Github</a>.
				</p>
				<h3>ü§ê Secrets</h3>

				<h2>üìñ Experience - Internships</h2>
				<h3>Enterprise Garage Consultancy, California - Summer 2017</h3>
				<p>
					Over the course of this Student internship I was coached by the companies Founder & CEO, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marioherger/" class="hide">Mario Herger</a>.
					Together, we welcomed delegations from German companies to learn about the "Silicon Valley Mindset", and how they could transform their company's culture to become
					more open-minded and diverse. To achieve this, we visited personalities from the Silicon Valley's Tech-Start-Up scene to talk about what makes working in the SF Bay Area
					different.<br>
					An additional task of mine was to assist in planning, conducting and editing Interviews with Engineers from both Tesla and Liquid Motors about the way the Automobile
					industry is changing to become more environmentally conscious. 
				</p>
				<h3>NDR (Norther German Broadcasting) - Summer 2018</h3>
				<p>
					During this internship, which I organized out of curiosity, I was able to get to know the inner workings of one of Germany's biggest public broadcasting companies.
					My main tasks were helping with the complete workflow of reports for the evening news, from planning over filming to editing, but I was also able to get to know
					how different live-TV formats get produced.
