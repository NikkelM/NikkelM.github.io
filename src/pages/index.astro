			<h2>Projects</h2>
			<p>
				Everyone's always working on something, and so am I. All of the projects below and many more can be found on my
				<a href="https://github.com/NikkelM" target="_blank">GitHub</a> profile.
			</p>

			<ProjectOverview title="Random YouTube Video" link="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/random-youtube-video/kijgnjhogkjodpakfmhgleobifempckf">
				<p>
					Random YouTube Video is a browser extension that allows users to truly randomly shuffle videos from any YouTube channel. The extension adds a 'Shuffle' button to channel, video and shorts
					pages. It allows for thorough customization through its popup, such as ignoring shorts or setting custom shuffle filters for each channel.
					<br />
					The extension is built using JavaScript, bundled with webpack. It's backend uses the YouTube Data API to fetch video data and stores and shares this data using a Firebase Realtime Database. User
					preferences are stored and shared across devices using the built-in chrome storage APIs. It's functionality is tested using a thorough test suite implemented with mocha and expect.js, which tests
					a wide range of possible data states using a scalable permutation approach.
					<br />
					You can get the extension for
					<a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/random-youtube-video/kijgnjhogkjodpakfmhgleobifempckf" target="_blank">Chrome</a>,
					<a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/random-youtube-video/fccfflipicelkilpmgniblpoflkbhdbe" target="_blank">Edge</a>
					and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/random-youtube-video/" target="_blank">Firefox</a>. The extension is compatible with all Chromium-based browsers through the
					Chrome Web Store version.

			<ProjectOverview title="Todo PR Checker" link="https://github.com/marketplace/todo-pr-checker">
				<p>
					Todo PR Checker is a native GitHub app that checks Pull Request changes for <code>TODO</code> style action items and reports on them live in a comment with embedded code links. The app provides
					automated CI checks on each Pull Request update, with live updates and clear feedback when open action items are found. It supports a wide range of programming languages and offers powerful customization
					options such as excluding files using glob patterns or adding support for new languages and action items. The app is built using Ruby, deployed automatically after a new release by leveraging
					Google Cloud Build and hosted on Google Cloud Run.
					<br />
					You can get the app on the
					<a href="https://github.com/marketplace/todo-pr-checker" target="_blank">GitHub Marketplace</a>.

			<ProjectOverview title="Game Pass API" link="https://github.com/NikkelM/Game-Pass-API">
				<p>
					The Game Pass API CLI tool provides a quick and easy way to get a list of all games currently available on Xbox Game Pass on any given platform (Console, PC or through EA Play) in a given
					region. Using a configuration file, the type and format of many properties can be customized, from simply getting the game's names all the way to fetching store prices at the moment of the
					request.
					<br />
					You can get the tool on
					<a href="https://github.com/NikkelM/Game-Pass-API" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

			<ProjectOverview title="Outlook Mail Notes" link="https://github.com/NikkelM/Outlook-Mail-Notes">
				<p>
					Outlook Mail Notes is an Outlook Add-In which allows you to add notes to e-mails, conversations and senders. The Add-In will automatically add a relevant category to the message, so you
					don't loose track of which messages have notes attached. The Add-In is written in TypeScript and uses the OfficeJS API to interact with a user's mailbox. To ensure compatibility with older
					Outlook versions, babel is used to convert syntax to be usable with Internet Explorer. The project is bundled and deployed using webpack and GitHub pages.
					<br />
					You can add the Add-In to your Outlook client using the following manifest URL:
					<a href="https://nikkelm.dev/Outlook-Mail-Notes/manifest.xml" target="_blank" class="hide">https://nikkelm.dev/Outlook-Mail-Notes/manifest.xml</a>.
					<br />
					You can also find more detailed installation instructions on the project's
					<a href="https://github.com/NikkelM/Outlook-Mail-Notes" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>.

			<ProjectOverview title="Notion integrations">
				<h4>
					<i>
						<a class="hideAlways" href="https://github.com/NikkelM/JSON-to-Notion" target="_blank">JSON to Notion</a>
					</i>
				</h4>
				<p>
					I've also created a number of Notion integrations you can try out for yourself! The one I find most useful is the "JSON to Notion" integration, which allows you to import JSON files to your
					Notion database. Using a configuration file, you can specify which properties of your JSON file should be imported to which database field, and define other transformations as necessary. You
					can find the project on
					<a href="https://github.com/NikkelM/JSON-to-Notion" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
				</p>
				<h4>
					<i>
						<a class="hideAlways" href="https://github.com/NikkelM/Notion-Steam-API-Integration" target="_blank">Steam API integration</a>
					</i>
				</h4>
				<p>
					Another Notion integration that connects your Notion database to Steam. All you need to do is add a Steam app ID field to your database, define which app properties you would like fetch, and
					the integration will automatically update your database entries. As always, you can find the tool on
					<a href="https://github.com/NikkelM/Notion-Steam-API-Integration" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

			<ProjectOverview title="Three.js" link="/threejs.html">
				<p>
					Three.js is a JavaScript library that allows for the creation and display of 3D computer graphics in a web browser. In April 2022, I built a very small demo page using the library, which you
					can find linked in the menu or here:
					<a href="/threejs.html">ThreeJS demo</a>.
